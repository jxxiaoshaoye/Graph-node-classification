# Graph-node-classification
This is our project on graph node classification, using Cora dataset.

**By Yihao Liu & Xinyi Ye & Lingyu Zhang**

We applied both Spectral method and Spatial method.

For Spectral based method, we apply GCN as backbone, fixing computation complexity and over-smoothing problem.

For Spatial based method, we compare it to Spectral based method and turned out to perform better.
